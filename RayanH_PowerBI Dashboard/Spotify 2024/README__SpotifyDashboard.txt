The 'covers.py' file retrieves image URLs for each song in 'Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2024' and appends them as a new column, generating an updated version of the original CSV file. A Spotify Client ID and Client Secret are required for authorisation with the Spotify Web API in order to execute 'covers.py'. However, I have provided an updated version of the original - 'Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2024 with Covers'.
